                To access this feature, normally you would navigate to the
                <strong>Publications</strong> page and click on the "add" floating action button, but since the <strong>Publications</strong> page does not yet
                exist at the time of writing, the only way to access this feature is through the direct link to the page. Note that because of this, the button
                below would normally link to the <strong>Publications</strong> page, so the tester would have to go through the same flow of steps to use the
                feature as the user would, but now links to the <strong>Add Publication</strong> page.
